- Tell user if invalid pattern
- Surround WebServer code in try/except/finally and report any errors
- Add built in patterns which aren't based off maths eg scrolling text or snakes etc.
    + User can set them but not remove them

    + PixelWriters will exist in a list of "builtinPatterns" with names
    + Created by a factory so only one place needs updating
    + the list can be iterated over to find all the names and add them to another table
    + User can set them just like the mathematical patterns
