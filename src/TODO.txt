- Surround WebServer code in try/except/finally and report any errors
- Add more builtin patterns
- When snake loses flash before restarting
- Make Game of life restart when reaches a 1, 2 or 3 period steady state
- Reformat builtin patterns into 2 rows and/or scrolled table
- Better builtin pattern names
- Snake can get caught in infinite loop
- Need to make it such that only unique names can be added
- Create script that creates an automatic connection to wifi

- Extend patterns such that when they are clicked the user is send to a
  new page with any configurations to be made
    + Will require a new branch for development

- Create wifi connector object to run before starting the web server
    + Display the ip address on the table
    + Warn the use if network not found
    + Since auto connecting to the wifi is complex on a pi this could be shipped
      out to an esp8266 running micropython which would parse the web requests,
      send the responses and then send the pi serial messages to change patterns
- This has has been made where the esp8266 simply redirects the get requests to the pi via serial then
  the pi parses, acts then sends the html response back to the esp8266 via serial
- Both sides seem to work independently but combining them has been fruitless so far
- MockWebLauncher can be used to show the pi end responding to a get request
- Putty can be used to show the esp8266 sending a get request then forwarding on the returned html
