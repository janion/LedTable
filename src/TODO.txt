- Surround WebServer code in try/except/finally and report any errors
- Add more builtin patterns
- When snake loses flash before restarting
- Make Game of life restart when reaches a 1, 2 or 3 period steady state
- Reformat builtin patterns into 2 rows and/or scrolled table
- Better builtin pattern names
- Fix leds on pi to know that data is recieved by the strip in GRB
- Snake can get caught in infinite loop

- Create wifi connector object to run before starting the web server
    + Display the ip address on the table
    + Warn the use if network not found
    + Since auto connecting to the wifi is complex on a pi this could be shipped
      out to an esp8266 running micropython which would parse the web requests,
      send the responses and then send the pi serial messages to change patterns
- This have been implemented but needs testing
- The pi side works fine but the esp8266 side didn't seem to do anything much.
  It kinda connected(after the browser timed out) but no response and no serial requests.
  I wander whether the serial messages just aren't getting to the usb

- Extend patterns such that when they are clicked the user is send to a
    new page with any configurations to be made
